I want you to upgrade my existing KolamKala website into a highly accurate, professional, fully interactive web application. The two MOST important modules are:

Kolam Analyzer (AI + Image Processing + ML)

Kolam Generator (Custom Kolam SVG Engine)

You must rebuild or improve the entire frontend + backend with increased accuracy, better UI/UX, optimized code, and more datasets.

🔥 1. Global Requirements

Modern, elegant UI with South-Indian theme (Kolam-inspired backgrounds, pastel pink, maroon, gold, white).

Fully responsive layout.

Smooth animations and transitions.

Interactive hover effects, scroll effects, professional typography.

Improve performance, loading time, caching, and API responses.

Use clean folder structure: /client (frontend), /server (backend).

Add documentation for all APIs and components.

🔥 2. Kolam Analyzer — Improve Accuracy + Add ML

Rebuild/improve the analyzer with best possible techniques:

Image Processing (OpenCV / Python / Node Bindings)

Dot grid detection:

Detect dots clearly

Count rows, columns

Detect spacing

Symmetry detection:

Vertical symmetry

Horizontal symmetry

Radial symmetry

Pattern type classification:

Sikku Kolam

Neli Kolam

Pulli Kolam

Geometric Kolam

Freehand Kolam

Extract additional features:

Color palette

Line thickness

Curves vs straight lines

Complexity score

Add improved contour detection + smoothing.

Add noise removal and perspective correction.

Machine Learning

Add a small CNN / image classifier model trained on at least 500+ kolam samples.

Support image preprocessing pipeline.

Output accuracy %, confidence score, classification labels.

Analyzer UI

Drag-and-drop uploader

Real-time feedback UI

Before/After comparison view

Visual overlays showing detected grid or symmetry

Downloadable Analyzer Report (PDF/PNG)

🔥 3. Kolam Generator — Improve Output Quality

The Generator should produce higher quality SVG and PNG designs.

Capabilities Required

Choose Kolam style:

Sikku

Neli

Pulli

Geometric

Choose:

Complexity Level

Symmetry Type

Dot Matrix (rows, columns, spacing)

Color Modes

Stroke Width

Pattern variations

Add custom algorithm to generate:

Smooth bezier curves

Dot-based symmetric kolams

Layered geometric kolams

Full mandala-style kolams

Output formats:

SVG (vector)

PNG (high resolution)

Add:

Randomize Pattern button

Download Pattern button

Share Pattern link

Generator AI Upgrade

Add generative pattern logic:

Constraint-based algorithms

Symmetry-based tile expansion

Curve connecting algorithms

Allow the user to save & load patterns.

Add side preview panel with zooming and rotation.

🔥 4. Learning Module Improvements

Level-wise structure:

Level 1: Beginner

Level 2: Intermediate

Level 3: Advanced

Add:

Step-by-step GIF animations

High-quality video tutorials (embedded)

Practice exercises

Quizzes

Downloadable worksheets

🔥 5. History Module

Rebuild with:

Detailed origin of kolam

Evolution timeline with images

Cultural significance

Mathematical foundation

Types of traditional kolams

Interactive image galleries

🔥 6. Contact Module

Beautiful form

Store submissions in database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

Success/failure alerts

Dark/light theme support

Add FAQ page

🔥 7. Additional Requirements
Add a Kolam Dataset Library

Include at least 50–150 sample kolam images for training & demonstration.

Categorize them by style.

Improve Code Quality

Add TypeScript

Add API validation

Add error handling

Add logs

Add comments

Deployment

Must run seamlessly in Replit

Provide .replit and run command

Support production mode build

⚡ Final Output Expectations

Deliver a fully improved KolamKala application with:

Highly accurate Analyzer

Smart Generator

Professional UI

Interactive animations

Organized code

Full documentation

All assets included

Works end-to-end in the browser

Make everything extremely polished, beautiful, functional, and production-ready.
